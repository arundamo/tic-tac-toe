# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python and Pygame library. It allows two players to take turns marking squares on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay: Play against another human player.
- Simple AI opponent: Play against the computer with an easy difficulty level.
- User-friendly interface: A graphical user interface (GUI) is provided using the Pygame library.
- Customizable options: Choose board size and AI difficulty level.

3. Run the game:

## How to Play

- The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns clicking on empty squares to mark them with their symbol (either X or O).
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
- If all squares are filled without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.

## Customization

- You can customize the game settings at the beginning of the code:
    - Board size: Choose between a 3x3 grid or customize it to your preference.
    - AI difficulty level: Choose between easy, medium, or hard.

## Controls
